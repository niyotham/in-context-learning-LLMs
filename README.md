# In-context-learning-LLMs
The world is going through a revolution in art (DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagine, etc.), science (AlphaFold), medicine, and other key areas, and this approach is playing a role in this revolution.  

In-context learning, popularized by the team behind the GPT-3 LLM, brought a new revolution for using LLMs in many tasks that the LLM was not originally not trained for. This stands in contrast to the usual fine-tuning that used to be required to equip AI models to improve performance in tasks they were not trained for. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66441805/190220884-7fe41a69-86cf-45a0-a438-73bd03e008ab.png)

However, LLMs are complex and require so much in terms of THE cost and and skills to be trained and Produce acurate results. Only Big companies are able to train them using  billions of parameters because they can afford the resources needed. Having shown good impact on the society and the business in general, knowing how to use giant AI models for multiple case in business and social problems is vital.

 It is predictedd that  more organizations are going to start centering their businesses on LLMs and similar products such as DALL-E 2, MidJourney, Bloom, etc. Therefore,specialized people in prompt engineering demand will grow fast. It is time to start getting familiar with these technologies.
