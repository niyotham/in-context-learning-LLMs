# In-context-learning-LLMs
The world is going through a revolution in art (DALL-E, MidJourney, Imagine, etc.), science (AlphaFold), medicine, and other key areas, and this approach is playing a role in this revolution.   However, LLMs are complex and require so much in terms of THE cost and and skills to be trained and Produce acurate results. Only Big companies are able to train them using  billions of parameters because they can afford the resources needed. Having shown good impact on the society and the business in general, knowing how to use giant AI models for multiple case in business and social problems is vital.

 It is predictedd that  more organizations are going to start centering their businesses on LLMs and similar products such as DALL-E 2, MidJourney, Bloom, etc. Therefore,specialized people in prompt engineering demand will grow fast. It is time to start getting familiar with these technologies. 


## Word Embedding
In word embeddings approach individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. Word embeddings provides a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding. They are not computed manually, and weights are learned by the model during training, in the same way a model learns weights for a dense layer.
